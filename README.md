Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models.

-> Dataset
The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Titanic challenge.

-> Steps
- Data Cleaning (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations of survival rates by class, gender, etc.)
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

-> Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 78%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 82%

-> How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run all cells
   
------About the DataSet-------
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
